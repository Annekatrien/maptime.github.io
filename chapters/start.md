## Setting up your Chapter Website

![](/img/toronto-page.png)

There are now two great ways to quickly integrate your Chapter with the Maptime community! 

1. Manage a page on Maptime's site
2. Manage your own Github repository

### Managing your own page

To manage a single page on Maptime's site requires a little git know-how but we're here to help. Follow these steps to start your own page inside Maptime's repository.

#### Fork the maptime.github.io repository (repo)
1. Log into your [Github account](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/) and navigate to the [Maptime site repo](https://github.com/maptime/maptime.github.io).
1. Click the `Fork` button in the upper right and select the account you wish to fork the main site to. Forking a site means you're making a copy of it your account and the origin repo maintains all changes you make to your site. Anything you change to your forked repository will.

1. 

First, you can [fork](https://github.com/maptime/maptime.github.io/fork) the maptime.io website, and add a new directory for your city like `/atlanta`. Each time you post a new blog post or Chapter meeting it will automatically appear both on your Chapter's homepage and on the front of [maptime.io!](http://maptime.io)
