<h2><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;">Maptime is, rather literally, time for mapmaking. Our mission is to open the doors of cartographic possibility to anyone interested by creating a time and space for collaborative learning, exploration, and map creation using mapping tools and technologies.</span></h2>
<p>This open learning environment for all levels and degrees of knowledge offers intentional support for the beginner. Maptime is simultaneously flexible and structured, creating space for workshops, ongoing projects with a shared goal, and independent/collaborative work time.</p>
<p>Beginners most welcome!</p>
<p><strong>History</strong><br>
Maptime was started as an idea at the&nbsp;<a href="http://stateofthemap.us/">2013 State of the Map US</a>&nbsp;conference in response to talk by Alyssa Wright challenging the lack of diversity in OpenStreetMap contributions. Inspired and wanting to become a better mapmaker too, Beth decided that she wanted to make time, once a week, to get together with friends&nbsp;and make maps. Camille liked the idea and helped to host the first one at Stamen’s office.</p>
<p>And so Maptime was born, at about 6:30 p.m. on June 13, 2013, in San Francisco, CA:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This initial burst of energy quickly caught the attention of Open Geo in Cleveland run by <a href="https://twitter.com/skorasaurus" target="_blank">Will Skora</a> and map education enthusiast <a href="http://twitter.com/lyzidiamond" target="_blank">Lyzi Diamond</a>, who started the original Portland chapter. These people and others jumped on board, and have been helping to shape the Maptime community ever since. Their local groups have set the precedent for the dozens of Maptime chapters now peppering North America and beyond.</p>
<p><strong>Inspiration</strong><br>
Inspiration for Maptime comes from both hack nights and knitting circles. Both are models of spaces for people to create and learn together. Our goal is to provide this space with an open heart and without pretension. You can bring your own projects to work on, or just hang out and socialize or ask questions. Some people are experts, and some people are just getting started, but all of us are learning, so why not do it together?</p>
<p>That’s our story. Come be a part of it.</p>
