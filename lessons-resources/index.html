<p>Part of opening the doors to cartographic possibility includes pointing to some helpful educational materials. Some of these we make on our own, and others we reference from the vast universe of the internet. That&#8217;s where so many of us got stuck trying to make web maps on our own, which is why so many of us have gravitated towards Maptime in the first place!</p>
<h1>Maptime Materials</h1>
<p>Maptime materials are designed for students to learn with and teachers to teach with. These materials are our open source offering, available for you to fork on Github and modify for your class or notes. All we ask is that you credit Maptime for anything other than personal (just you by yourself) use.</p>
<p>For all Maptime tutorials, including works in progress, please visit:</p>
