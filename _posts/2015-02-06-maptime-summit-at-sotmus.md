Mark your calendar, and make your travel arragements! We are having our second annual Maptime Summit (and our first full-day affair) on Monday, June 6, 2015, in conjunction with the [OpenStreetMap State of the Map US](http://stateofthemap.us/) conference!

And if that wasn't amazing enough, we get to have it at the United Nations headquarters in New York City!

We will post more details in the coming months, but for now we are planning a single track of workshops, lightning talks, and discussion that will happen in parallel with the SOTMUS hackathon day on Monday. Maptime chapter organizers, attendees, and any kind of map fans are all welcome and encouraged to attend!

Got questions? Email hello@maptime.io for answers! See you in NYC!
