[FOSS4G](http://2014.foss4g.com) is just a week away, and we at MaptimeHQ are gearing up! We’re extremely excited for the conference, not least of all due to the massive amount of participation from Maptimers around the world. (And perhaps the births of a few new chapters?) Here’s a list of everything we have going on at FOSS4G:

Maptime is super pleased to host a [ridiculous party](http://maptimeparty.splashthat.com) to celebrate the massive growth of the organization over the past year — there are now more than THIRTY Maptimes! — as well as the first birthday of [MaptimeNullIsland](http://twitter.com/MaptimeNull).

**Maptime Birds of a Feather Session**

Come to our ad-hoc session and chat with Maptimers from around the world! We’ll be doing a short introduction to Maptime and providing resources for new chapters as well as facilitating a discussion for Maptime organizers in order to share best practices and get advice on future meetups. Should be a ton of fun!

**Wednesday, September 10th, 3pm-4pm**

Alyssa will be doing a presentation on building a ideologically diverse community of mappers through a variety of events, including MaptimeNYC! I (Lyzi) will also be doing a short talk on starting your own Maptime chapter.

Rafa’s workshop will cover several core aspects of the most recent versions of the Leaflet and Mapbox JavaScript libraries. Each topic discussed will be followed with a hands-on exercise using live examples.
