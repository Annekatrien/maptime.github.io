This is so great! I love that so many people showed up tonight to learn about making maps! 

Things we learned today include:

**Relations** = collection of nodes and ways (or, really, a collection of objects). For example, in OSM, Lake Merritt is a relation comprised of the outlines of multiple islands and a shoreline.

**CartoDB!** some of us played with [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com/). I managed to import all of the nodes from the [SF Green Map](http://www.opengreenmap.org/greenmap/san-francisco-green-map), producing the image below. Next up: playing with CartoCSS to make San Francisco look a little less infected!

**Leaflet Tutorial!** Someone did a [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) tutorial and reported that it needs some updating. I did not do it so I cannot report on specifics. 

Also, weâ€™ve set up a [Maptime Github](https://github.com/maptime/maptime), so that we can do things like post tutorials and notes there. Coming soon: this author learns how to use Github AND Terminal! I WILL NOT BE AFRAID OF CODING ENVIRONMENTS!

People socialized and worked on maps. Super fun. More maptime next week!
