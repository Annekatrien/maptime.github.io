Everyone at Maptime is excited to announce our very first project: the ABCs of Cartography! The goal is to create a children’s book (or ebook, map mashup) illustrating cartographic terms using maps made at Maptime. And not just the one in San Francisco: New York, Portland, DC and maybe Cleveland all want to get involved too.

Step one is to create a glossary of terms (we’re being really inclusive of digital mapping and data viz words, jfyi). The picture above shows most of the words we came up with on 8.15, which are now logged on github.

Over the next few weeks while we’re on break (more on that in the next post) we encourage Maptimers to keep logging terms and defining them! If you’re not already a member of the group, go to this page to have an organizer in your city set you up:

https://github.com/maptime/maptime/wiki/Local-maptime-groups

Once we have a bunch of terms defined in the wiki (which shouldn’t take long), the SF group will start some weekly workshops, on Leaflet, OSM, TileMill, and CartoDB. After that, we get to illustrating using the new skills we learn!

There may be more terms than people, which is cool, because it means reaching out to map and dataviz artists! Hooray! BUT FIRST, let’s see what some of you new mappers out there can bring to the table.

So! That’s the plan, and we’re already off to a great start! Follow the link above and get involved! Can’t wait to see what we make together.
