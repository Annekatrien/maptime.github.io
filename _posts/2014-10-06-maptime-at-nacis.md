The [NACIS annual meeting](http://nacis.org/annual-meeting/current-meeting) is this week, and Maptime will be representing in full force! If you're going to be in Pittsburgh next week as well, be sure to come up and say hi to us at one of the many following events and talks:

**Practical Cartography Day**  
**Wednesday, October 8th, all day**  
**Pittsburgh Marriot City Center, Marquis A + B**

Organized by Maptimers [Rosemary Wardley](http://twitter.com/rosemarydaley) ([MaptimeDC](http://twitter.com/maptimedc)) and [Andy Woodruff](http://twitter.com/awoodruff) ([MaptimeBoston](http://twitter.com/maptimeboston)), Practical Cartography Day is a day-long series of short talks seeking to answer some of those pesky cartographic problems we encounter on a daily basis. This year's session will feature more than twenty presentations on all aspects of practical map creation, including a couple from Maptimers [Lyzi Diamond](http://twitter.com/lyzidiamond) ([MaptimeOAK](http://twitter.com/maptimeoak)) and [Alan McConchie](http://twitter.com/mappingmashups) ([MaptimeSF](http://twitter.com/maptimesf)).

At the end of Practical Cartography Day, Lyzi will also be giving a short, five-minute talk on why you should start a Maptime chapter. Should be educational and fun!

**Maptime Happy Hour**  
**Wednesday or Thursday evening**

Find the folks with the rainbow stickers to discover where and when we'll be hosting our happy hour!

**Maptime Lunch Bunch**  
**Friday, October 10th, noon**  
**Leaving from Pittsburgh Marriot City Center**  

Maptime is leading a NACIS lunch bunch! Sign up at the registration desk to have lunch with Alan and Lyzi and ask any questions you might have about Maptime.

There are also many more Maptimers speaking throughout the conference, so be sure to make a thorough perusal of [the schedule](http://nacis2014.sched.org/). We can't wait to see you there!
