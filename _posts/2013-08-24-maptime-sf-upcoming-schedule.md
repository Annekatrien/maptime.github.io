Ahoy! If you haven’t already seen it on Twitter, then hear it here! Maptime SF is on break until Sept. 5, when we’ll reconvene and chack our progress on the ABCs glossary. After that, we’ll be starting up our workshops! Here’s the breakdown:

Sept. 5 - Glossary checkin. ALSO…do we like Thursdays? Let’s tawk :)

Sept. 12 - OSM 101

Sept. 19 - Leaflet tutorial walkthrough

Sept. 26 - CartoDB + Tilemill

October = making month! Pick some terms to illustrate and then let’s work on it together!

More soon…likely after Camille and I are back from the Burning Man. Cheers!
