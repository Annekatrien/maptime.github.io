It never ceases to amaze me how many people get excited about OSM! We had about 40 people show up to celebrate, so many that we ran out of seats!

Nevertheless, [Alan](https://twitter.com/mappingmashups) still managed to do an OSM 101 tutorial in Stamen’s conference room. Some people in there made their very first edits!

Outside of the conference room, well, it kind of turned into a big party. That’s cool, we can take a night off from learning for beers and a mapcake…

Again, happy birthday OSM! And to sweet [Stephanie](https://twitter.com/mizmay), of Urban Mapping fame.
