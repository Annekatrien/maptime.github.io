Today is [#GISDay](https://twitter.com/hashtag/gisday) and it's also our first [#MaptimeNontupleConjunction](https://twitter.com/hashtag/MaptimeNontupleConjunction)! Yes you read right, nine #maptimes in the same day! We've got California covered with #MaptimeSF and #MaptimeLA, and #MaptimeCorvallis is repping the great Northwest with their second meetup. In the center of the country MaptimeBoulder is teaming up with OpenStreetMap to do some food security mapping. On the East Coast we have #maptime powerhouses MaptimeNYC and MaptimeBoston working their open source and open data magic. Canada won't be left out, with MaptimeWindsor/Essex giving some maptime love to Western Ontario and the Greater Detroit Area. Last but not least, overseas we are welcoming MaptimeAmsterdam and MaptimeJohannesburg into the Maptime fold! Maptime <3 <3 <3 worldwide!ï»¿
