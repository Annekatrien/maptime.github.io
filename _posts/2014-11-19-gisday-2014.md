Today is [#GISDay](https://twitter.com/hashtag/gisday) and it's also our first [#MaptimeNontupleConjunction](https://twitter.com/hashtag/MaptimeNontupleConjunction)! Yes you read right, nine #Maptimes in the same day! We've got California covered with [#MaptimeSF](http://www.meetup.com/Maptime-SF/events/218159582/) and [#MaptimeLA](http://www.meetup.com/MaptimeLA/events/211734772/), and [#MaptimeCorvallis](http://www.meetup.com/Maptime-Corvallis/events/214794302/) is repping the great Northwest with their second meetup. In the center of the country [#MaptimeBoulder](http://www.meetup.com/Maptime-Boulder/events/213829952/) is teaming up with [OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmap.org/) to do some food security mapping. On the East Coast we have #Maptime powerhouses [#MaptimeNYC](http://www.meetup.com/Maptime-NYC/events/217002222/) and [#MaptimeBoston](http://www.meetup.com/Maptime-Boston/events/217580172/) working their open source and open data magic. Canada won't be left out, with [#MaptimeWindsorEssex](https://www.facebook.com/events/1504902196442474/) giving some #Maptime love to Western Ontario and the Greater Detroit Area. Last but not least, overseas we are welcoming [#MaptimeAmsterdam](http://www.meetup.com/Maptime-AMS/events/213796602/) and [#MaptimeJohannesburg](http://www.meetup.com/MaptimeJozi/events/216742472/) into the #Maptime fold! Maptime <3 <3 <3 worldwide!ï»¿
