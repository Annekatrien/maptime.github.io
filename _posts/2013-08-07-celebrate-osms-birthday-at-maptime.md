title: Celebrate OSM’s Birthday at MapTime!
category: blog

description: "It never ceases to amaze me how many people get excited about OSM! We had about 40 people show up to celebrate, so many that we ran out of seats!
Nevertheless, [Alan](https://twitter.com/mappingmashups) still managed to do an OSM 101 tutorial in Stamen’s conference room. Some people in there made their very first edits!"

This week, [Open Street Map celebrates its 9th birthday](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Birthday, and we’ll be joining the festivities at MapTime with all kinds of OSM activities, including OSM 101 and the [OSM #birthdaySprint!](http://osmlab.github.io/birthday-sprint/locations/) The studio will be set up so that people can either work on their #birthdaySprint projects or partake in learning and project sharing. 

Here’s the schedule for the evening:

**6:30** Doors open, c’mon down! 
**6:45** OSM 101
**7:00** Project show and tell! Share what you’re working on and get feedback
**7:30** Everybody work on OSM stuff! 
**8:30** Wrap up

So come out and join the mapnerdery! Just be sure to sign up on [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-OpenStreetMappers/events/130308822/).
